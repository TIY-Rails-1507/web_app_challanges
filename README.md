# Web App Challenges

These are some ideas for web applications to build. 

Please note that we have not yet covered all the topics you would need to do these. In fact we probably won't cover all the bits that would make these work in the class. 

However, you are encouraged to give at least one these a bash. If you get stuck you could ping the class on Slack and we will point you in the right direction.

## The Next Big Idea&trade;

Come up with an idea that interests you... 

Anything is good, the more practice you get the better.

## Rock Paper Scissors 2.0

Due to popular demand, RPS is going onto the web!

Create a simple app that let's a user play RPS against the computer. 

Hint: After Wednesday we would have probably covered enough to get this working in a simple way. 


## A Film Site

Create a site that lists a bunch of films, as well as data for each film. 

The fun bits: 
* Show trailers via embedding the YouTube player into your sites pages 
* Get the data from: http://www.omdbapi.com/


## Online Blackjack

Use the Deck Of Cards api to create a single player game of Blackjack.

API: http://deckofcardsapi.com/

This is obviously a lot more challenging, but it can be done - (I have not actually done, but I am suer you guys can)

Hint: To get started simply display two random cards at a given URL.


## Where in the world?

Come up with an idea that let's you integrate with the Google Maps API.

E.g. In the 'explore' app, we can show exactly where a hotel on Google Maps.


It should also be possible to determine where the user of the site is.... 


## Other API ideas

Do something with the Trello, Twitter, or GitHub API...
